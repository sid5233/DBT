1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.
ANS:-CREATE INDEX d_order ON orders(odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all 
   current values are unique)?
ANS:-alter table orders add constraint U_o_Onum unique (Onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.
ANS:-CREATE INDEX I_DATE ON orders(odate);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is
 currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.
ANS:-ALTER TABLE customers add  PRIMARY KEY (rating);
